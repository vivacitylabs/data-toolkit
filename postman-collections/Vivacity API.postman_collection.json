Crossings are deduplicated such that any given road user can only be recorded crossing a countline once. This is important to note as pedestrians often go back and forth over countlines as their motion is far less constrained than other road users.  \n\nIn the cases where a road user crosses a countline multiple times only the first crossing, and the information associated with it, is registered. This is important to note when analysing timestamps of crossings or their associated direction.  \n\nThe endpoint returns an array of time classified crossing data. Each time bucket contains the number of crossings witnessed disaggregated by road user classs for each countline direction. Data is provided for both countline directions, if requested and the countline has been configured to provide data for both directions.  \n<!-- theme: info -->  \n> **Info**<br>Empty results, both for classes and time periods, are excluded unless the parameter `fill_zeros` is set to `true`.\nData can be presented as either raw counts or as Passenger Car Units (PCUs).

Journey times are calculated as the time taken between an road user crossing the `origin_countline_id` and `destination_countline_id`. Note, journey times are only recorded for road user classes with license plates.  \n\nFor a journey to be registered it's number plate **must** be captured crossing both countlines and deciphered correctly. \n<!-- theme: info -->  \n> **Info**<br>Only journey times **under 2 hours in length** will be returned. \nThe endpoint returns an array of time bucketed journey time data. Each time bucket contains the following information aggregated across all road user classes:\n\n - Number of journeys\n - Mean journey time\n - Median journey time\n - 25th percentile journey time\n - 75th percentile journey time\n\nJourney times are returned in **seconds**.  \n\nBy default data is returned for all trips made in all directions. Data can be returned for trips in specific directions by specifying this in the request.  \n\nThe `Unknown` class can be selected and encompasses any object that the sensor was unable to successfully classify.  \n<!-- theme: info -->  \n> **Info**<br>Data can be disaggregated by road user if the `disaggregate_classes` is set to true. Note that the Classified Journey Time add-on **must** have also been purchased for this data to be available.\n",

Data prior to this point will be returned as null values as the metrics is unknown.\nValues can be provided for one or multiple viewpoints. Results are aggregated into buckets of specified duration. The options for these duration parameter align with those available in other endpoints to allow ease of comparison.  \n\nThe user can also request live periods to be returned using the `include_live_ranges` flag. If enabled, an array of start and end times indicating when the sensor was operational across the entire query period are returned alongside the bucketed data availability data.  \n<!-- theme: info -->  \n> **Info**<br>Data availability data is only available for viewpoints that are associated with **2nd generation VivaCity sensors**.\nIf the endpoint is queried for a viewpoint that is not compatible the endpoint will return null values as no heartbeat data available.  \n\nFinally, data availability data is correct at the time of retrieval. It is possible that the data availability metric could change due to late arriving data sent by a backup mechanism which stores data on the hardware in case of an outage. However, note that in these cases **a maximum of 24 hours of data** can be restored and infilled.\n",

Note, the use of API tokens will be deprecated completely by the end of 2024.  \n\n\nThis endpoint allows users to obtain an authentication token by providing valid user credentials. The token obtained can be used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected resources within the API.  \n\n  \nUsers should send a POST request to this endpoint with the user's credentials encoded in the request body. The credentials should be provided in urlencoded format.  \n\n\nTokens have an expiration time, after which it becomes invalid and needs to be refreshed.\n",

New users must instead set up API keys using the steps outlined [here](https://vivacitylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PKB/pages/2759557127/Supported+API+authentication+methods). Note, the use of API tokens will be deprecated completely by the end of 2024.\n\n\n  This endpoint allows users to refresh an authentication token using a valid refresh token. Authentication tokens have a limited lifespan for security reasons. When a token expires, users can use a refresh token to obtain a new authentication token without requiring the user to reauthenticate.  \n\n\n  To refresh a token, users should send a POST request to this endpoint with the refresh token provided in the request body. The refresh token is created alongside the authentication token during the initial authentication process.  \n\n\n  Upon successful refresh, the server responds with a new authentication token that can be used for subsequent requests. Refresh tokens themselves also have expiration times.  \n\n\n  It's important to securely transmit refresh tokens and handle them with care to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information.\n",

While data can still be requested through this endpoint, it will be removed entirely by the end of 2024.<br><br> Users using API keys for authentication should request countline counts using the **[countline/counts](https://docs.vivacitylabs.com/#/operations/getCountlineCrossings)** endpoint.\n\nThe user can specify which countlines to get counts for. These can be filtered by time and class.  \n\nBy default this endpoint will return classified counts from the last 5 minutes, across all the countlines from the sensors the user has access to.  \n\nCounts will be grouped into 5 minute buckets within the specified time range. If the start or end time of a specified time range do not fall on 5 minute interval times, the buckets beginning within the interval will be returned instead.  \n\nWe currently offer 13 classifications: `cyclist`, `motorbike`, `car`, `pedestrian`, `taxi`, `van`, `minibus`, `bus`, `rigid`, `truck`, `emergency_car`, `emergency_van`, `fire_engine`. Note that querying for `emergency_car`, `emergency_van` or `fire_engine` requires using an underscore and will not work with a space or dash.  \n\nIf you’re seeing more than the 13 classses listed above, we’ve recently released a 32 classification beta.\n",

Endpoints referring to the V2 platform can be found under the *legacy* nesting in the sidebar. These are set to be deprecated [across 2024](https://vivacitylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PKB/pages/2859204612/API+deprecation+plan).\n\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Authentication 🔐\nThe VivaCity Traffic Monitoring API supports two authentication methods:\n\n  * [API keys](https://vivacitylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PKB/pages/2759557127/API+authentication+methods#API-Keys) \n  * [API Tokens](https://vivacitylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PKB/pages/2759557127/API+authentication+methods#API-Tokens)\n\nAs of June 2024, API keys is the main form of authentication supported.\n<!-- theme: info --> \n \n> **Have existing integrations using API tokens?**<br>Credentials can still be used to generate API tokens. This form of authentication will remain valid until **the end of 2024**.\nYou will be able to add, view and manage your API keys using the newly released [User Settings page](https://admin.vivacitylabs.com/settings/api-access).\n\n## Guides and Documentation 📃\n\n  * New to APIs? \n  * Wanting to plug our data into your own dashboard?\n  * Want to know some tips and tricks?\n\nCheck out our quickstart [guide](https://vivacitylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PKB/pages/2600566802/Getting+started+with+the+API) and other help [docs](https://vivacitylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PKB/pages/2586771489/API).  \n\nStill stuck or want to know more please reach out to [support@vivacitylabs.com](mailto://support@vivacitylabs.com).\n### Postman Collection\nIf you are planning to or would like to use Postman we have you covered with our [Postman collection](https://vivacitylabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PKB/pages/2600173735/Using+Postman). Import this collection and immediately get cracking.\n## Versioning ⏫\nWhen breaking changes are made to the API, we release a new version. To make our user experience more seamless we will soon support multiple versions of select individual endpoints.\n## Rate Limits and Fair Usage 🛑\n<!-- theme: info --> \n \n> **Getting stung by our rate limits?**<br>Please reach out to [support@vivacitylabs.com](mailto://support@vivacitylabs.com).\nAll endpoints are subjected to the same global rate limits. Simultaneous request limits of  `300/minute`  and  `7200/hour`  are applied to each source IP address. \nWhen either limit is exceeded, a  `429 Too Many Requests`  response is returned along with the following JSON response body:\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"API rate limit exceeded\"\n}\n```\nThe following Request Headers are also set:\n```\nX-RateLimit-Limit-minute: 300 // allowed requests per minute\nX-RateLimit-Remaining-minute: 296 // remaining requests this minute\nX-RateLimit-Limit-hour: 7200 // allowed requests per hour\nX-RateLimit-Remaining-hour: 7184 // remaining requests this hour\n```\n## Error Tracing 🐞\nWhen an error occurs, the API returns standard HTTP status codes. In addition, the response body contains a string object with a message that describes the error. For all responses, apart from 429 Too Many Requests, we return a unique request id with the key `Request-ID` in the response headers to help us trace the error. Please include the `Request-ID` in any support requests.\n\n## API Latency ⏲️\nUnder normal operation conditions, we expect to receive feature data within 60 seconds of it being captured on our sensors. This should be taken into consideration when querying data in a given time bucket as it is possible that only some of the data is available. \n\nFor example, when querying data for a five minute period, 15:30 -> 15:35, at:\n\n  * 15:33 is 😞 \n  * 15:36 is 😐 \n  * 15:40 is 😄 \n\n## Interpreting our Metadata 🗃️\n### Metadata Hierarchy \n\n - Hardware\n   - Viewpoint\n     - Countline\n     - Zone\n\n### Metadata Types\n#### Hardware\n\n  - Is the physical sensor.\n  - Hardwares are the parent entity from which all of our metadata connects to\n\n#### Viewpoint\n\n  - Relates to the camera found in our sensors.\n  - Most sensors have a single lens active and thus only one viewpoint associated.\n  - Common exceptions to this our sensors running ANPR features as often one lens will be configured to collect ANPR data  whilst the other is configured for other data feeds.\n\n#### Countline \n\n  - Is a virtual line drawn across the road space.\n  - Is used to measure road user behaviour.\n  - Certain feature data points relate to the moment an object crossed a countline.\n\n####  Zone\n\n - Is a virtual area drawn to cover a segment of the road space.\n - Much like countlines is used to measure road user behaviour.\n - Select feature data points relate to times at which an object is within, enters or leaves a zone.\n\nContact Support:\n Name: VivaCity Customer Support\n Email: support@vivacitylabs.com",
