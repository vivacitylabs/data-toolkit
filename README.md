# Vivacity data toolkit (dev version)
This repository stores notebooks and similar data tools to help you retrieve and/or analyse VivaCity data. 

## Notebooks

The repository contains a collection of notebooks to allow easier data downloads for a number of data features via the API. It is aimed as an **interim solution** while we're working on new dashboard developments. You can contact your customer success manager for more information.

### How it works

Select the notebook you need
- [Countline Speed bulk download]
- [Journey Times bulk download]
- [Classified Counts bulk download]

Each notebook will run you through all the necessary steps and will save a final csv file in your Google Drive.
You can also make changes to code (if you wish) or save the notebook to your own Google Drive. 

### What you need

- A Google account
- VivaCity API login credentials
- Countline ids / sensor numbers you want to download data for
